# ComputerVisionClassification


In this report, there are four models for image classification, using two CNNs, pre-trained fine-tuned AlexNet and DAG-SVM trained of feature extracted from AelxNet.

1. **Dataset:** Download the 15-scene dataset from [MIT Scene 15](http://www-cvr.ai.uiuc.edu/ponce_grp/data/scene_categories/).  
2. **Structure:** Ensure images are organized into `train/` and `test/` folders with subfolders for each class.    
4. **Model Parameters:** Download pretrained **AlexNet weights** from [PyTorch Model Zoo](https://download.pytorch.org/models/alexnet-owt-4df8aa71.pth) or simply run the code the first time an those will be automatically downloaded 

On the Jupyter Notebook there are all the steps to run the four models.
